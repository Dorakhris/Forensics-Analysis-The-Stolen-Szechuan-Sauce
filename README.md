# Forensics-Analysis-The-Stolen-Szechuan-Sauce

## Project Overview

"The Stolen Szechuan Sauce" is a digital forensics investigation project that simulates the process of tracking down a stolen proprietary recipe. This project involves analyzing various digital artifacts to uncover the truth behind the theft, employing a range of tools and techniques commonly used in the field of cyber forensics.


## Introduction
This project was inspired by the famous incident where a special sauce was stolen. The aim is to simulate a digital forensic investigation into such a theft, focusing on tracing the digital footprints left behind by the perpetrator. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the importance of digital forensics in solving cybercrimes.

## Objectives
- To simulate a real-world digital forensic investigation.
- To analyze digital artifacts such as logs, emails, and metadata.
- To uncover the perpetrator and the method used to steal the sauce.

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used in this project:
- **Autopsy**: A digital forensics platform for analyzing disk images.
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer used for monitoring and analyzing network traffic.
- **FTK Imager**: A tool for creating forensic images of hard drives and other media.
- **Python**: For scripting and automating parts of the analysis.

## Insights
- This Project will focus on answering the following questions:
- a. What’s the Operating System of the Server?
- b.What’s the Operating System of the Desktop?
- c. What was the local time of the Server?
- d. Was there a breach?
- e. What was the initial entry vector (how did they get in)?
- f. Was malware used? If so what was it? If there was malware answer the following:
- What process was malicious?
- Identify the IP Address that delivered the payload.
- What IP Address is the malware calling to?
- Where is this malware on disk?
- When did it first appear?
- Did someone move it?
- What were the capabilities of this malware?
- Is this malware easily obtained?
- Was this malware installed with persistence on any machine?
- When?
- Where?
- g. What malicious IP Addresses were involved?
- Were any IP Addresses from known adversary infrastructure?
- Are these pieces of adversary infrastructure involved in other attacks around the time of the attack?
- h. Did the attacker access any other systems?
- How?
- When?
- i. Did the attacker steal or access any data?
- When?
- j. What was the network layout of the victim network?
- k. What architecture changes should be made immediately?
- l. Did the attacker steal the Szechuan sauce? If so, what time?
- m. Did the attacker steal or access any other sensitive files? If so, what times?
- n. Finally, when was the last known contact with the adversary?
